##### ****ExtractTextFromImageOrScannedPdfUsingBestOcrDataset.vbs:**
    
```
' This example demonstrates the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text 
' from scanned PDF documents and raster images.


' Create TextExtractor object
Set extractor = CreateObject("Bytescout.PDFExtractor.TextExtractor")
extractor.RegistrationName = "demo"
extractor.RegistrationKey = "demo"

' Load sample PDF document
extractor.LoadDocumentFromFile("..\..\sample_ocr.pdf")


' Enable Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
extractor.OCRMode = 1 ' OCRMode.Auto = 1

' Set the location of OCR language data files
extractor.OCRLanguageDataFolder = "c:\Program Files\Bytescout PDF Extractor SDK\ocrdata_best"
			
' Set OCR language
' "eng" for english, "deu" for German, "fra" for French, "spa" for Spanish etc - according to files in "ocrdata" folder.
extractor.OCRLanguage = "eng"  
' Find more language files at https://github.com/bytescout/ocrdata/tree/master/ocrdata_best

' Set PDF document rendering resolution
extractor.OCRResolution = 300


' You can also apply various preprocessing filters to improve the recognition on low-quality scans.
' But they significantly hit the performance, so do not enable them by default.

' Automatically deskew skewed scans
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddDeskew()

' Remove vertical or horizontal lines (sometimes helps to avoid OCR engine's page segmentation errors)
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddVerticalLinesRemover()
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddHorizontalLinesRemover()

' Repair broken letters
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddDilate()

' Remove noise
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddMedian()

' Apply Gamma Correction	
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddGammaCorrection()

' Add Contrast
' extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddContrast(20)


' (!) You can use new OCRAnalyzer class to find an optimal set of image preprocessing 
' filters for your specific document.
' See "OCR Analyser" example.

	
' Save extracted text to file
extractor.SaveTextToFile("output.txt")

WScript.Echo "Extracted text saved as 'output.txt'."

Set extractor = Nothing
